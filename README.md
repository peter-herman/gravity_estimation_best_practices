# Code and Data Files for "Gravity Estimation: Best Practices and Useful Approaches"
Thsi repository contains code and data files for running the examples from "Gravity Estimation: Best Practices and Useful Approaches" by Peter Herman (2023). There is a single do file that sequentially runs all the different gravity examples and outputs tables of estimates. A zip file contains three .dta data files:

1. **aggregate_foreign_trade.dta**: International aggregate trade flows and gravity covariates.
2. **aggregate_domestic_trade.dta**: Domestic aggregate trade flows and gravity covariates.
3. **sectoral_trade**: International and domestic trade flows for four broad sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, energy and mining, and services) as well as gravity covariates.
