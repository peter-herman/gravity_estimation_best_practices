# Code and Data Files for "Gravity Estimation: Best Practices and Useful Approaches," 2023
This repository contains code and data files for running the examples from "Gravity Estimation: Best Practices and Useful Approaches" by Peter Herman (available at [usitc.gov](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/working_papers/herman_2023_gravity_estimation.pdf)). There is a single do file that sequentially runs all the different gravity examples and outputs tables of estimates. A zip file contains three .dta data files:

1. **aggregate_foreign_trade.dta**: International aggregate trade flows and gravity covariates.
2. **aggregate_domestic_trade.dta**: Domestic aggregate trade flows and gravity covariates.
3. **sectoral_trade**: International and domestic trade flows for four broad sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, energy and mining, and services) as well as gravity covariates.

To run the examples, set the current directory to the location to the folder containing the three data files.
